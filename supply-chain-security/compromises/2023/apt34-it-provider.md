# APT34 Targets UAE in Supply Chain Cyberattack

## Incident Details

APT34/OilRig conducted a cyber espionage operation against UAE government
targets through a supply chain attack. They created a fake IT company
website, using a malicious IT job recruitment form to infiltrate an IT
company's systems. Upon opening the document, malware was executed,
collecting sensitive information and credentials.

According to the research by Kaspersky, the malware samples used in the
UAE campaign resembled those used in a previous APT34 supply chain intrusion
in Jordan that used similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),
including targeting government entities.

## Impact

> Kaspersky couldn't verify if the government attacks were successful due
> to its limited downstream visibility, but "we assess to medium-high
> confidence" that they were, Yamout says, given the group's typical success
> rate.

## Type of Compromise

- **Trust and Signing**: Utilized fake entities and documents to gain trust
and access.
